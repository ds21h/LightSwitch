LightSwitch

Version 1.0 - 04-12-2018
 - English translation of LichtSchakel
 - Changed to English protocol for esp switches
 - Uses package jb.light.support
 - Stopped using packages jb.licht.klassen and jb.licht.gegevens

Version 1.0.1 - 14-01-2019
 - Logmessage for Time lights off enhanced
 - Bug fixed in LightOffPeriod (used Settings.xPeriod instead of Settings.LightOffPeriod)

Version 1.1 - 07-06-2021
 - Enhanced LightSensor. Instead of just counting the cycles needed to reach 'High' on the sensorpin the elapsed time (in hundredth if a millisecond) is returned. The OpenJDK runtime changes the algorithm used during execution (it gets much more efficient) so 'number of iterations' is no longer comparable.
 - Deleted obsolete support for FM switches.
 - Uses upgraded LightSupport.jar (Version 1.1)
